# Framer Motion Workshop 

This is a small website built to showcase the animation library [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/docs/introduction/) in combination with [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/docs) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).

To save some time and still have a decent look I've used [this design](https://dribbble.com/shots/17355271-Speechmatics-homepage), which was made by Gil Huybrecht.


## Unique Features

- [Page Transitions](https://www.framer.com/docs/animate-presence/)
- [SVG line drawing](https://www.framer.com/docs/component/###svg-line-drawing)
- [Automatic animation of css changes](https://www.framer.com/docs/animation/#layout-animations)
- [Physics based transitions](https://www.framer.com/docs/transition/#spring)


### Get started

1. `yarn install` - Installs all dependencies
2. `yarn dev` - Runs the app in the development mode
3. `yarn build` - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder

> Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
